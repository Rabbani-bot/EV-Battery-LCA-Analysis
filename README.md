# EV Battery Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)

## Project Overview
This project utilizes Python to perform a comparative analysis of NCM811 and LFP battery chemistries, focusing on the trade-off between Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Human Toxicity Potential (HTP).

## Key Findings
- **NCM811** demonstrates a significantly higher toxicity footprint due to Cobalt and Nickel mining.
- **LFP** remains within the "Sustainable Zone" for both Carbon and Toxicity metrics.

## Methodology
Data is simulated based on literature averages (ISO 14040 compliant boundaries). Uncertainty intervals represent standard deviations in mining efficiency.
